# Introduction

In this notebook, we will reproduce the results published in **Characterization of Term and Preterm Deliveries using Electrohysterograms Signatures**[^1]. The paper proposes a method for **preterm birth prediction** using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers trained on Electrohysterogram (EHG) signals. The birth which takes place before the completion of 37 weeks is known as Preterm birth. EHG signals are recorded by placing four electrodes on the mother's abdomen. 

We will recreate the Support Vector Machine classifier with the highest recorded accuracy among all classifiers proposed in the paper. However, the paper has one major shortcoming: oversampling was performed on the entire dataset, leading to data leakage and inflated performance scores.

To find out why Data Leakage is problematic and how we can fix it, continue reading.

# Step-0 Extraction of Features from EHG Signals (Optional)

The **Term-Preterm EHG Database**[^2] is a collection of EHG signals obtained from 1997 to 2005 at the University Medical Centre Ljubljana, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology. The dataset consists of EHG signals obtained from 262 women who had full-term pregnancies and 38 whose pregnancies ended prematurely. We'll download this dataset and extract features from it.


Follow these steps to download the dataset and extract features:

1. Download TPEHG DB from [Physionet](https://physionet.org/content/tpehgdb/1.0.1/tpehgdb/) [^3]
2. Open Terminal (MacOS) or Command Prompt (Windows)
3. Navigate to the `medicine_preprocessing-on-entire-dataset` directory.
4. Run the following commands:

  4.1 `pip install -r requirements.txt`

  4.2 `mkdir individual_features`

  4.3 `python3 make_features1.py <path>` 
  
    Replace <path> with the absolute path to tpehgdb directory present inside term-preterm-ehg-database-1.0.1 
  
    Example: `/Users/.../.../term-preterm-ehg-database-1.0.1/tpehgdb`

  4.4 `python3 make_features2.py`


For more details on how features were extracted from raw EHG signals, refer to [^1] and [EHG-Oversampling](../EHG-Oversampling).

# Step-1 Loading the dataset

In this section, we will load the dataset from the CSV files created in the previous step. 

For a quick refresher on the Pandas module, [check this out](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/10min.html).

:::

::: {.cell .code}
```python
import os
import pandas as pd
#Loading feature vectors
X=pd.read_csv(os.path.join('..','raw_features.csv'))
X.head()
```
:::

::: {.cell .code}
```python
#Loading labels
Y=pd.read_csv(os.path.join('..','target.csv'))
Y.head()
```

## Exploring the dataset
Here, we will identify data types, check for null entries, compute summary statistics, and visualize the dataset using `matplotlib`.

:::

::: {.cell .code}
```python
#Information about data types of the features
X.info()
```
:::

::: {.cell .code}
```python
#Statistics of the features
X.describe()
```
:::

::: {.cell .code}
```python
#checking for null values
X.isnull().sum()
```
:::

::: {.cell .code}
```python
#Barplot of two classes
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
labels=['Term','Preterm']
term_count=(Y['0']==1.0).astype('int').sum()
preterm_count=(Y['0']==0.0).astype('int').sum()
plt.bar(['Term Births','Preterm Births'],height=[term_count,preterm_count],color=['tab:green','tab:red'])
plt.ylabel("Frequency")
plt.xlabel("Type of Birth")
plt.show()
```
:::

::: {.cell .code}
```python
#Visualisation of the dataset using Principal Component Analysis
from sklearn import decomposition
pca = decomposition.PCA(n_components=2)
pca.fit(X)
X_tran = pca.transform(X)
for i in range(X_tran.shape[0]):
    plt.scatter(X_tran[i,0],X_tran[i,1],c="tab:red" if Y['0'][i]==0.0 else "tab:green" )
```
